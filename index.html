            <h4>American singer-songwriter</h4>
            <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans
                multiple
                genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received
                widespread
                media coverage and critical praise.
                Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue
                a
                career in country music. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a
                recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005, and released her eponymous debut studio album in 2006.
                Swift explored country pop on her second and third studio albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010);
                the
                success of the singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" on both country and pop radio established
                her
                as a leading crossover artist. Swift experimented further with pop, rock, and electronic genres on her
                fourth studio album, Red (2012), which was supported by the singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back
                Together" and "I Knew You Were Trouble". With her synth-pop fifth studio album 1989 (2014) and its
                singles
                "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood", she departed her country image and transitioned to pop
                completely. </p>
